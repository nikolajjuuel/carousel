A quick fun little project on improving a logo carousel. I'm using the programming language logos that I've used. Instead of using CSS keyframes that limit user interaction, I made a carousel with more input. IMO this also gives the animation a better flow as it does not have a hard reset phase which can be seen at times with keyframes. 
* The animation slows down when the mouse approaches the logos
* Stops when the mouse is on a logo
* The flow of the animation can be changed by hovering over the chevrons
