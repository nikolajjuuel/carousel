A quick, fun little project where I improved a logo carousel using programming language logos I’ve worked with.
Instead of relying on CSS keyframes—which limit user interaction and often have a noticeable “reset” phase I built a more interactive carousel with smoother, continuous motion.

✨ Features:

* The animation slows down as the mouse approaches the logos.
* It pauses when hovering directly over a logo.
* The direction and speed can be adjusted by hovering over the chevrons.
